### What I learned

Throughout this project, I practiced using Tailwind CSS for styling and layout. The following code snippet illustrates how Tailwind CSS classes are applied to create a responsive and visually appealing section:

```html
<!-- Example of Tailwind CSS classes for styling -->
<section class="bg-main text-white py-10 px-20 md:px-10 scroll-mt-24" id="order">
    <h2 class="pb-4 md:text-7xl font-bold text-5xl">DRINK IT ALL IN</h2>
    <p class="pb-8">
        Premium Quality Tea At Your Fingertips.
    </p>
    <button class="p-2 bg-white text-main font-semibold cursor-pointer">Order Now</button>
</section>
```
